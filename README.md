# The Walk-In
all of your restaurant's orders in one place

# UPDATE - The AWS Instance and VPC that provided the website functionality have been disabled due to recurring costs. 

This is a personal project written for my ACA Capstone App. The overall project goal is to build an application that can be used by restaurant management to consolidate their ordering process. It will provide the functionality to place orders for multiple vendors in one application, which will then separate and send the orders to the proper vendors.

# Technologies used in the building of this app include:

- JavaScript
- React.js
- react-bootstrap
- Redux and Redux Thunk
- AWS RC2 and VPC
- Node.js
- Express.js
- sequelize
- Auth0 for authentication
